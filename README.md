# bergfex_snowalert_part_II
Part II of this project focusses on the visualisation of webscraped data through tableau.

This repository showcases the visualization of data obtained and prepared in our Part I repository where we webscraped the Bergfex webpage (mountain sports information webpage) adding snow level information to each activity. It was elaborated by Malwina San José and Sarah Dutschke. 
We use TableauPublic for creating single plots, dashboards and stories.######

Project description
-------------------
Planning hikes in winter time can be complicated in Switzerland. Sometimes hiking in the snow is an exciting adventure, but it can also be an unexpected surprise. In part I of our project, we webscraped information of the different hikes (#### potentially add all sports) and added  information on current snow levels based on spatial data. 
In this project we focus on the visualization of such data with tableau, making the selection of the right #### hike more userfriendly.
