This repository showcases the visualization of data obtained and prepared in our part I repository where we webscraped the Bergfex webpage (mountain sports information webpage) adding snow level information to each activity. It was elaborated by Malwina San José and Sarah Dutschke. 
We use TableauPublic for creating single plots, dashboards and stories.######

Partners
 -------
[Bergfex](https://www.bergfex.com/) is a company that provides a wide range of information about mountains (such as mountain activities, weather information, accommodation options etc.).

Project description
-------------------
Planning hikes in winter time can be complicated in Switzerland. Sometimes hiking in the snow is an exciting adventure, but it can also be an unexpected surprise. In part I of our project, we web-scraped information of the different mountain activities and added information on current snow levels based on geospatial weather data. 
In this project, we focus on the visualisation of such data with Tableau, making the selection of the right activity more user-friendly.

Project Milestones
-------------------
### Data Preparation
Luckily, we have scraped, cleaned the information in part I of our project. However, for certain plots (line chart), we need to prepare the data in a different format. We take advantage of Python for a quick rearrangement in a Jupyter Notebook.

### Milestone 1
We have created a How-to Tutorial for:
 - Creating single charts of interests in Tableau.
 - Creating an interactive dashboard in Tableau.
 - Formatting charts and dashboard in Tableau.

 ### Milestone 2
We have created project with a statistical analysis of our web-scraped data:
 - 
 - 
 - 
 

Outcomes
